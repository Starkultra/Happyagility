538,Celebrating Our 60th Anniversary with Trip of a Lifetime,"My husband and I will be celebrating our 60th wedding anniversary later this year and decided to take the trip of our lifetime to the Canadian Rockies. Due to COVID we can't travel until 2021.  Because we are both 78, it was recommended that we probably need travel insurance. What a new and frustrating experience that was. I filled out many applications for quotes and checked all the reviews.  There were a lot of  unhappy travelers out there and it scared me. I tried calling many of the agencies and was on hold forever.  Is this how it would be if I called from Canada with an emergency or claim?  After many hours of searching with no comfort level, I decided to try again the next day and maybe I could talk to a live person to answer my concerns.This morning, I started fresh and called the first company AARDY.  Almost immediately I had a cheery person answer.  Her name was Denise and she answered every one of my questions, gave me quotes and suggestions.  She was wonderful. She sent me emails so I could see what the policy covered and the conditions.  She spent a lot of time with me and I went ahead and purchased the policy.  I felt relieved that I finally ""bit the bullet"" and got the insurance.  Thank you, Denise and AARDY.

I still don't understand why - my trip is still six months away. I could understand if they say within even 60 days of the trip.  Consequently, I learned that this is the policy and there are no exceptions. Purchase your trip insurance the same day you book your trip if you want 100% coverage for any cancellation reason.

They communicated directly with Seven Corners on my behalf. All good things.  HOWEVER, I had to call Aardvark again because the dates of birth for the covered insureds were ALL wrong (for all four of us!) when I received the policy from Seven Corners. Additionally, the wallet ID receipt-of-purchase amount lists the incorrect total for our policies (not sure if it matters, but with insurance, I don't want to mess with anything being incorrect in the documentation). I would expect Aardvark to have communicated this information correctly to Seven Corners in the first place AND to check the policy to make sure it was written as requested.

3797,I'd never heard of AardvarkCompare‚Ä¶,"I'd never heard of AardvarkCompare before. Number one, I've never needed international travel insurance before. I've usually, domestically, purchased simple insurance simultaneous with booking my flight(s).It's hard trusting business's these days, and, there are too many to choose from. I stumbled on AardvarkCompare through AARP.  I trust AARP as do 31m others'.  One doesn't have to be in their 60's to reap the benefits AARP has fully researched to provide to their readers.  I live in Chicago and have a new home in rural so. west France.  Due to visa's I'm back and forth every 90 days. 90 days leaves a lot of exposure to the possibilities for the unforeseen to occur.  I chatted online with Jonathon who gave gr8 information.  I come from an artist's brain, the right side, my mind doesn't retain and/or compute figures well which the left brain excels at. Jonathon gave me the option to speak to a live person. I opted for it.  I connected with Lynn who was fantastic.  What a wonderful, empathic woman who you can tell loves working in the travel insurance industry, Jonathon, too.  I hadn't booked my tkt. yet, and it's important to do so, first, yet, one doesn't have to have a ticket to call in for information.  Since I hadn't booked yet I told Lynn I'd call back when booked. When I'd booked, I called back and talked to Alise, another delightful human being; all these I've communicated with seemed like family member's who have interest in supporting their loved one's. I was to purchase insurance for 90 days.  Then, at the last moment, I thought to myself, I'm going to return back to the states in 89 days just to be safe with leaving France before my 90 day visa was up. I told Alise this and she said, ""Wow, that's even better. There are more benefits when under 90 days."" I ended up saving more than $200.00 just by leaving a day earlier!!  I felt so supported.  It was a rather a quick question-and-answer-period before I put down my credit card.  Not only was the price gr8, I feel there's a freedom now that I have this insurance.  This freedom comes from feeling protected.  If I were to need assistance, it's a simple click on a link, then let them know how they can help, from injury, lost baggage, lost passport, hospital.  For instance, your baggage is late or missing, you go to baggage claim for assistance, ask for a voucher, then clink on that link, and go from there. If a lost passport, notify the police, they'll write a report, then click on that link... . It's the first time I've ever had a car.  I'm male, 64, and, and, and... .  International traveling is what makes a journey.  It's a different journey in the states as I'm accustomed to the circus it's become.I leave in two days.  I just had kidney stone surgery last week then again two days ago. I feel weak, and a lot of discomfort, to be expected.  My movers take all into storage for three months. My new place closes mid-sept. I had shoulder surgery last Feb.13th, and just before I left FR last Nov. my beautiful kitchen had a gas line explosion and totaled it. My six wonderful French neighbor-Angels, with my insurance, rebuilt it.  My brother and his partner arrive in 7 days, my sister-in-law arrives in 13 days. Although, I've only been twice at 3 months a pop, I feel like I'm going home.  I don't speak French, at all, In that I click on that link, I'm sure all languages will be spoken.

I wanted to purchase a policy to cover a trip 9 months out, but to get the pre-existing condition waiver had to purchase within 21 days of my first payment.  I had only paid a small deposit, with the balance due in 6 months.  Alyce advised I could buy the policy and cover the deposit for a smaller premium and then raise the coverage within 21 days of paying the balance to keep the waiver.  This makes sense as why pay the full premium to cover only a fraction of the total cost.  If I cancel within the next six months, I'm only out the deposit and I wouldn't need any medical, evacuation, trip interruption, etc. coverage!  This was a very different scenario from a policy I purchased from Viking for a trip last year.  I paid the entire premium up front, the cost was much higher and the coverage less.  In future I will deal with Aardvark and skip the insurance offers from the cruise lines.",5, Excellent,7/25/2019,20:35,"Weiner, Elyse",6,spoke alyce meserve provide excellent advice guidance want purchase policy cover trip  month preexisting condition waiver purchase  day payment pay small deposit balance  month alyce advise buy policy cover deposit small premium raise coverage  day pay balance waiver make sense pay premium cover fraction total cost cancel month deposit need medical evacuation trip interruption etc coverage different scenario policy purchase viking trip year pay entire premium cost high coverage future deal aardvark skip insurance offer cruise line

4948,Excellent advice and turnkey service. Recommended,"I am finally getting around to submitting this review for Aardvark. Last October and November, my 87-year-old father, aunt and I went on a wonderful transatlantic cruise from New York to the UK, followed by 10 days in Rome. My father  is well enough to travel, but of course, at his age, he has health issues. Also, I had fears of him having a fall on Rome‚Äôs ancient streets, or  that he might unexpectedly be hospitalized for a serious health emergency and costly  medevac home. Fortunately, everything was fine, and we had a wonderful, safe trip. Jonathan helped me find a policy that had significant medical and medevac coverages, and cancel-for-any-reason coverage. The peace of mind that this coverage provided was well worth the premium, and of course, any health issue or serious injury could happen to any of us, young or old.  I had many questions for Jonathan before and after purchasing coverage, and he was always available, often when I would call late in the evening, due to my work schedule. He answered every question thoroughly and professionally; he is obviously extremely knowledgeable of his insurance product (his online articles and advice are also excellent). He provided value-added service in advising me during coverage selection and facilitating prompt  execution.  He also assisted in adding coverage for travel accommodations that I purchased later in our trip planning.  It would‚Äôve been much more difficult doing this myself. Although my elderly father‚Äôs needs formed the primary impetus in securing coverage, I will henceforth always  purchase  this kind of coverage for myself, and I intend to use Aardvark going forward;  it is a fallacy to assume a mishap will befall only the elderly, and the peace of mind that this coverage provides is worth every penny, whether for an elaborate vacation or a simple business trip.  Given the several legs/connections in our journey, I was also glad to have the baggage loss and trip delay insurance, where the terms are much more generous than regular coverages;  we did not need to use it, but it was good to know that we would have good coverage in those kinds of aggravating circumstances. My aunt arranged her coverage separately, and she too was well pleased with Jonathan‚Äôs and Aardvark‚Äôs service.   Prompt execution was also valuable, as certain coverages are time sensitive in purchasing.",5, Excellent,2/4/2019,16:40,Patrick Hughes,6,finally get submit review aardvark october november yearold father aunt go wonderful transatlantic cruise new york uk follow  day rome father travel course age health issue fear fall rome  ancient street unexpectedly hospitalize health emergency costly medevac home fortunately fine wonderful safe trip jonathan help find policy significant medical medevac coverage cancelforanyreason coverage peace mind coverage provide worth premium course health issue injury happen young old question jonathan purchase coverage available late evening work schedule answer question thoroughly professionally obviously extremely knowledgeable insurance product online article advice excellent provide valueadded service advise coverage selection facilitate prompt execution assist add coverage travel accommodation purchase later trip planning  difficult elderly father  need form primary impetus secure coverage henceforth purchase kind coverage intend use aardvark go forward fallacy assume mishap befall elderly peace mind coverage provide worth penny elaborate vacation simple business trip give legsconnections journey glad baggage loss trip delay insurance term generous regular coverage need use good know good coverage kind aggravate circumstance aunt arrange coverage separately pleased jonathan  aardvark  service prompt execution valuable certain coverage time sensitive purchasing
