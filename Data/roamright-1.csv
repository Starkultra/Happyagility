15,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.   In the end, we really want to feel secure knowing any insurance company will have our back according to the purchased policy or service. I don't have that with this Roam Right Insurance.

Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.   In the end, we really want to feel secure knowing any insurance company will have our back according to the purchased policy or service. I don't have that with this Roam Right Insurance.

115,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

235,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.   In the end, we really want to feel secure knowing any insurance company will have our back according to the purchased policy or service. I don't have that with this Roam Right Insurance.

As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

395,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.   In the end, we really want to feel secure knowing any insurance company will have our back according to the purchased policy or service. I don't have that with this Roam Right Insurance.

435,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

555,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.   In the end, we really want to feel secure knowing any insurance company will have our back according to the purchased policy or service. I don't have that with this Roam Right Insurance.

595,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

715,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.   In the end, we really want to feel secure knowing any insurance company will have our back according to the purchased policy or service. I don't have that with this Roam Right Insurance.

755,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

875,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.   In the end, we really want to feel secure knowing any insurance company will have our back according to the purchased policy or service. I don't have that with this Roam Right Insurance.

915,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

1035,Will Roam Right do the Right Thing?,"After a number of years, 2020 will be last year we purchase travel insurance from Arch Roam Right for the two of us. As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

As in purchasing any insurance, one wants to know if insurance companies will  readily assist their customers when a legitimate claim (s) is filed according to the policy or be adversarial toward claimants in order to place profit ahead of the good of their customers. This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.

This past year we purchased travel insurance in December 2019 for 2020 travels, Then March, 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like most all our planned travels (5) for the whole year were cancelled. Our travel agencies, airline companies  and resorts either refunded or credited us all payments made for trips in 2020. Many of our travel partners also received credit for future use or refund from their travel insurance companies for cancelled trips.We contacted Roam Right twice requesting credit for future use or refund for travel insurance paid for 2020 based on the cancellations of all our trips. In both cases, we were told the that the policy of the company was not to provide any numerations....no reason(s) given.  In conclusion, here is a company willing to take payment and offer no commodity, service, liability or even a chance of liability....in other words pure profit.  So what do I draw from this. I can't help but deduct that Roam Right would be a company to shrug or skirt any responsibility if we were to file a claim.
